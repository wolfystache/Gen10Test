In this folder you will find two directories, LuckySevens and RestaurantSite. In the LuckySevens folder, you will find 
a file 'luckySevens.html'. You can open this file in your browser to run the Lucky Sevens problem. 

In the RestaurantSite folder, you can open the 'index.html' file to go to the home page of the Restaurant Site.

The scripts for both of these problems are in a folder called scripts, located in each of their individual directories.
